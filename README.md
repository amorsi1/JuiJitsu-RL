## WIP

This is a personal project that aims to train reinforcement learning agents on the game of jui jistu and pin them against each other. To my knowledge this hasn't been done before in Jui Jitsu and is an opportunity to test different models and representations for their effectiveness.

The project is still in the preprocessing phase, and I've been parsing through all of @Eelis and @ScottyChung work on the GrappleMap database to use their directed Graph as the state space for this agent.
